## What drove me to the idea of QAK-TAK!!  

Well , first i was bored and wanted to spend time with people and every other one i know personally is busy with their own works.
Then i tried to meet new people online , but didnt find a right one nor a right platform , then this idea came up and spent time on devloping Qak-Tak rarther than searching people.

## Future ideas 

- Video Calling
```
This generation cant resist only with chat  . So yeah , 
there is a plan to include video calling in our app interface.
```

- Location sharing
```
Ya , this is very useful and important to meet , right?
```
- And many more intresting features is yet to come
